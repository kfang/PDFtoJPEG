# PDFtoJPEG
Simple JavaFX Application written in Scala to convert a PDF Document into JPEGs.

This application is pretty straightforward (I think). Choose a PDF Document, choose a directory to save the images in,
and click convert.  The application will then proceed to convert each page of the pdf document into a JPEG, saving them
into the directory you chose. When its done, it will conveniently open the directory so you can see all the JPEGs.

##Bugs?
Please file them in Github issues. I only have a Windows/Linux machine so if you have issues with OSX, donate a mac to
me and I can hopefully try to fix it.

##Feature Requests?
Kindly file them in Github Issues.

##TODO
- [ ] allow choosing different output formats
- [ ] look into .doc/.docx conversion
- [ ] include a prepackaged fat jar for those who just want to use it
